**opentripplanner** is an R package that provides a simple yet flexible interface to [OpenTripPlanner (OTP)](https://www.opentripplanner.org/). OTP is a multimodal trip planning service written in Java. For more information on what OTP is, see the [prerequisites vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html).

**opentripplanner** can be used to interface with a remote instance of OTP (e.g. a website) or help you set up and manage a local version of OTP for private use.  Basic setup and routing functions are outlined in the [getting started vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/opentripplanner.html), while advanced functionality such as batch routing, isochrones, and customised setup is described in the [advanced features vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/advanced_features.html).

## What's New

The newest version of the package 0.5.0 (Jan 2023) focuses on increased routing speeds (3-4x faster) and expanding support for OTP v2.2. The new version also drops legacy support for R 3.6, and so now requires R 4.0 or later. See [news](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/news/index.html) for more details.

## Installation

### OpenTripPlanner

To use OpenTripPlanner on your local computer you will need to install Java 8 and download the latest version of OTP. Instructions on installing Java and setting up OTP can be found in the [prerequisites vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/articles/prerequisites.html).

### R Package

To install the stable CRAN version:

```{r installCRAN, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("opentripplanner") # Install Package
library(opentripplanner)            # Load Package
```

Install the development version using **remotes**:

```{r install, eval=FALSE}
# If you do not already have the remotes package
install.packages("remotes")
# Install the package from GitHub
remotes::install_github("ropensci/opentripplanner")
# Load the package
library(opentripplanner)
```


## Usage

The package contains three groups of functions:

Functions for setting up a local instance of OTP:

1. `otp_dl_jar()`          To download the OTP Jar file;
1. `otp_dl_demo()`         To download the demo data for the Isle of Wight;
1. `otp_check_java()`      To check you have the correct version of Java;
1. `otp_build_graph()`     To make a OTP graph from raw data;
1. `otp_setup()`           To start up a local instance of OTP;
1. `otp_make_config()`     To make a config object;
1. `otp_validate_config()` To validate a config object;
1. `otp_write_config()`    To save a config object as a json file.

Functions for connecting to a local or remote instance of OTP:

1. `otp_connect()`      To connect to OTP.

Functions for retrieving data from OTP:

1. `otp_plan()`              To get routes from A to B;
1. `otp_geocode()`           To get the locations of named places e.g. road names (OTP 1.x only);
1. `otp_isochrone()`         To get isochrone maps (OTP 1.x only);
1. `otp_make_surface()`      To make an analyst surface (OTP 1.x only);
1. `otp_surface()`           To evaluate a analyst surface (OTP 1.x only);
1. `otp_traveltime()`        To make a travel time matrix (OTP 1.x only);
1. `otp_surface_isochrone()` To make a raster isochrone map (OTP 1.x only);

Results are returned as [sf objects](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=sf).
